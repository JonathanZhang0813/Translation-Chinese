Suppose you are in charge of a local community in the early stage of the pandemic. There are rumors that a few people here have strange symptoms similar to the highly infectious disease, but the situation is very unclear. Your policy belief will decide how the community reacts to it, with consequences in many aspects, and moreover, in people's life and death. 

Are you prepared for the responsibility? Now, please choose your belief.
