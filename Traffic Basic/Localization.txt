This model models the movement of <color=blue>cars</color> on a highway. Each <color=blue>cars</color> follows a simple set of rules: it slows down (<trigger=deceleration,#c1b90fff>decelerates</trigger>) if it sees a <color=blue>cars</color> close ahead, and <trigger=speed>speeds</trigger> up (<trigger=acceleration,green>accelerates</trigger>) if it doesn't see a <color=blue>cars</color> ahead.

Suppose you are in charge of a local community in the early stage of the <b>pandemic</b>. 

There are <color=red>rumors</color> that a few people here have strange symptoms similar to the highly infectious disease which leads to the pandemic, but the situation is <b>still unclear</b>. Your policy belief will decide how the community reacts to it, with consequences in many aspects, and moreover, in people's life and death. 

Are you prepared for the responsibility?
